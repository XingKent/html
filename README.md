<h1>Pet Shop</h1>
<h2>ğŸ“ƒ About</h2>
<p>Its about my first project for my college, i had to chose a theme and create a website about it. The first page you can see products for pet. The second page it's a simple form where you can send a e-mail for manager. The third page it's about me.<br>
Text on third page translated:<br>
"Guilherme Freire - I'm 21 years old, I study at EstÃ¡cio de SÃ¡ University - MaracanÃ£ and I intend to work with programming as soon as possible. I started to become interested in the subject at the end of my high school (2021) but I didn't know how to start, I even tried to take an online course (driven) but ended up giving up. In 2021 and 2022 I tried to take the entrance exam but ended up failing, so I decided to go to a private college and return to studying programming. I'm studying computer science and my hobbies are training at the gym, eating and supporting Vasco da Gama."
